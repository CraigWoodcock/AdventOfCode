What's the goal?
This kata is about decoding data which has been encoded to hide some data

You will receive a text file in which each line contains letters (upper and lower case) and digits

Find the first and last digit in each line and combine them in that order to form a 2-digit number

If a line contains only one digit, repeat it to form the 2-digit number

Add all the numbers for each line together to come up with a single integer

Example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77
Adding these together produces 142
